## Exercise 1 Answer and Explanation 

1 - what are the "max_bright" and "min_bright" values you found?

	max_bright = 29000
	min_bright = 8000

	We've conducted our light experiment in the Engineering Library on campus. So the values would change depending on the environment you are in. The following images [Exercise 1 - Light Data (1)] (https://github.com/f-libble/2024-mini/blob/main/assignment/Exercise%201%20-%20Video%20%26%20Screenshots/Exercise%201%20-%20Late%20Data%20(1).PNG) and [Exercise 1 - Late Data (2)] (https://github.com/f-libble/2024-mini/blob/main/assignment/Exercise%201%20-%20Video%20%26%20Screenshots/Exercise%201%20-%20Late%20Data%20(2).PNG) show the recorded values for max_bright and min_bright on our console. The following video demonstration show that with our max_bright and min_bright values, we are able to observer that the light on the Pi Pico board goes ON (lights up) when the photosensor determines that the room is dim or dark, and the light on the board goes OFF (gets dimmer) when the environment gets bright.

## Exercise 2 Answer and Explanation 

	Modifying the exercise_sound.py, it now generates sound using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) on a speaker to play the main melody of the Super Mario Bros theme. The melody is represented by a list of frequencies, and each note is played for a specific duration using a loop. The following video demonstration shows the Super Mario Bros theme song playing action.
