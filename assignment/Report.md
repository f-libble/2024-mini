## Exercise 1 Answer and Explanation 

1 - What are the "max_bright" and "min_bright" values you found?

- max_bright = 29000  
- min_bright = 8000  

We've conducted our light experiment in the Engineering Library on campus. So the values would change depending on the environment you are in. The following images show the recorded values for max_bright and min_bright on our console:

The following video demonstration shows that with our max_bright and min_bright values, the light on the Pi Pico board goes ON when the photosensor determines that the room is dim or dark, and the light on the board goes OFF when the environment gets bright. Watch the video here:

## Exercise 2 Answer and Explanation 

Modifying the `exercise_sound.py`, it now generates sound using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) on a speaker to play the main melody of the Super Mario Bros theme. The melody is represented by a list of frequencies, and each note is played for a specific duration using a loop. The following video demonstrates the Super Mario Bros theme song playing:
